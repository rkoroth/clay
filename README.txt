basically the doll.py is the main wrapper and often no need to modify.
and doll.py is not meant to be modified by user.

user will modify conf/play/xyz.yaml 
and the sequence.yaml for the sequence.

When to modify the doll.py .?

when we create any module for a specific task.

then we need to modify the doll.py (import that moddule)

module should be written in doll standard. so it will work seamlessly.
